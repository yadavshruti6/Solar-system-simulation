Frontend Developer Assignment:

The assignment is a single mobile-responsive web page.

Objective

Your task is to build a 3D simulation of the solar system using Three.js, a powerful JavaScript library for rendering 3D graphics in the browser.

This assignment will test your skills in 3D rendering, scene creation, object animation, and user interaction using pure JavaScript - without using any CSS animations.

1. Web Page + Styling

You must create a web page with a 3D canvas containing:

The Sun at the center of the scene

All 8 planets orbiting around it (Mercury to Neptune)

Each planet rotating around the Sun at a default speed

Realistic lighting, camera, and orbit animation

Use Three.js to:

Create the 3D objects (spheres for planets)

Set up lighting and camera angles

Animate planetary orbits using THREE. Clock, requestAnimationFrame, or GSAP (optional)

The scene should load quickly and work on all modern browsers.

2.Speed Control Feature (JavaScript)

Implement a control panel on the page that allows users to:

Adjust the orbital speed of any individual planet in real-time.

Use sliders or input boxes for each planet.

When the speed is changed, the planet's animation should reflect it immediately

This should be built using plain JavaScript, interacting with the Three.js animation loop.

3. Bonus Features (Optional)

These are not mandatory, but if you can implement them, it'll strengthen your submission:

A "Pause/Resume" animation button

Background stars in the scene

Labels or tooltips on hover over each planet

Dark/light toggle UI

Camera movement or zoom on click

4. Demo Video

Your screen recording (2-3 min) should show:

1. The 3D solar system in motion

2. Speed control working in real
